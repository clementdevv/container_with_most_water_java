# Bubble Sort in Java

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in Java. Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process repeats until the list is sorted.

## Features
- Simple, easy-to-understand sorting algorithm.
- Includes both ascending and descending order sorting.
- Command-line interface for demonstration and testing.

## How Bubble Sort Works
Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements in an array and swaps them if they are out of order. This process is repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted.

For example, if we have an array `[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`, Bubble Sort would sort it in ascending order as `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`.
