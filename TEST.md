# Bubble Sort in Java

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in Java. Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process repeats until the list is sorted.
